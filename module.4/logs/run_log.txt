Q: What are the production 'Do's' for RAG?
A: Based on the provided context, here are the production 'Do's' for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

1. Start simple and iterate based on metrics [1]
2. Use metadata filtering (product, language, permissions) [1]
3. Combine vector + keyword search (hybrid approach) [1]
4. Monitor retrieval quality (recall@k, precision) [1]
5. Keep embeddings synchronized with documents [1]
6. Evaluate with domain-specific questions [1]

Additionally, the context also mentions the following 'Do's' for RAG:

1. Use Hybrid Search (vector + BM25) as baseline [2]
2. Implement metadata filtering (security-critical) [2]
3. Monitor retrieval quality (recall@k, NDCG) [2]
4. Keep embeddings fresh (re-index on doc changes) [2]

These 'Do's' are mentioned in the context of production best practices for RAG.

Q: What is the difference between standard retrieval and the ColPali approach?
A: The ColPali approach differs from standard retrieval in that it uses a vision language model to directly embed image patches, rather than relying on OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text information. This allows for better results in terms of information retrieval from visual documents, with a 15% improvement over the standard retrieval system [4].

Q: Why is hybrid search better than vector-only search?
A: Hybrid search is better than vector-only search because it combines the strengths of both approaches. Vector-only search can miss exact matches and acronyms [1], while BM25-only search lacks semantic understanding [1]. In contrast, hybrid search uses a two-stage architecture with reranking to improve retrieval quality [6]. This approach has been shown to reduce retrieval failures by 67% [1] and achieve higher NDCG scores (+10.5% for Hybrid and +37.2% for Hybrid + Reranker) compared to vector-only search [2].
